Sticks and Stones is yet another vaporware roguelike set in the Stone Age. It
is intended to be the epic roguelike every naive roguelike developer wants to
create. As such, it will may never be finished and has been plagued by numerous
rewrites, redesigns, and real life deadlines. Furthermore, the intended scope
of the game means that the developer can continually be side-tracked by
interesting problems. Being vaporware, no official release date has been given,
but the author promises one is forthcoming.

Some of the planned features include:
* Expansive Stone Age overworld with diverse biomes
* Combat mechanics based on Cavemaster RPG
* Cycles for day/night and seasons
* Food and warmth required to survive
* Crafting system to produce survival tools
* Hunt with your fellow NPC tribe mates
