Sticks and Stones is yet another vaporware roguelike. It is intendent to be the
epic roguelike every naive roguelike developer wants to create. As such, it will
likely never be finished and has been plagued by numerous rewrites, redesigns,
and real life deadlines. Furthermore, the intended scope of the game means that
the developer can continually be side-tracked by interesting problems. Being
vaporware, no official release date has been given, but the auther promises one
is forthcoming.
